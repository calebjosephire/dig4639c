        The Tortoise and the Hare is a classic fable about a boastful hare who
        constantly brags about his speed. Tired of the hare’s arrogance, a slow
        but steady tortoise challenges him to a race.

        Overconfident, the hare sprints ahead and decides to take a nap midway.
        The tortoise, moving slowly and consistently, eventually passes the
        sleeping hare and wins the race.
